Project at University: Lane Detector using the Hough Transform

Work Done:
• Record of videos on a car to test the method.
• Pre-processing of the images using Gausian Blur and Canny Edge Detection.
• Own implementation of the Hough transform algorithm.
• Plot and output representation on the video frames.
• Developed completely in Matlab
